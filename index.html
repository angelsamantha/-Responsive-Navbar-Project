        <h2>I have a dark side, too</h2>
        <p> I'm generally confused most of the time. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>

            <li>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</li>
            <li>Like a sloth. I can do that.</li>
            <li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</li>

        <p>I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Hello, Dexter Morgan. You lookâ€¦perfect. <strong> Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</strong> <em> I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece.</em> And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
        <p>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
        <p>Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I love Halloween. The one time of year when everyone wears a mask ... not just me. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals.</p>
