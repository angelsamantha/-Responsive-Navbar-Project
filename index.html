        <h1>Dexter.</h1>
        <h2>I have a dark side, too.</h2>
        <p> I'm generally confused most of the time. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I'm really more an apartment person. I'm really more an apartment person.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece. And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</li>
            <li>Like a sloth. I can do that.</li>
            <li>Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Hello, Dexter Morgan. You lookâ€¦perfect. <strong> Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.</strong> <em> I feel like a jigsaw puzzle missing a piece.</em> And I'm not even sure what the picture should be.</p>
        <p>I'm thinking two circus clowns dancing. You? I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. With my own set of rules. I'm Dexter. Boo. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister.</p>
        <h1>Dracula</h1>
        <p>I could not but admire, even at such a moment, the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself.</p>
            <li> In all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world, Quincey Morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action, and Arthur and I had been accustomed to obey him implicitly.</li>
             
        </p> Now, the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively. With a swift glance around the room, he at once laid out our plan of attack, and, without speaking a word, with a gesture, placed us each in position. Van Helsing, Harker, and I were just behind the door, so that when it was opened the Professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door. Godalming behind and Quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window. We waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness. The slow, careful steps came along the hall; the Count was evidently prepared for some surprise--at least he feared it.</p>
